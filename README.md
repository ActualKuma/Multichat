Type each stream you want to have in chat into the input and click open chats

for any stream badges you want to add, add the image you want to denote their chat into the channel folder with named as the channel name in all lowercase

Also can source streams from url in the format https://multichat.dev/?openStreams=streamone%20streamtwo%20streamthree

Works for any number of streams as you'd like, but it works much better for 2-3 streams maximum
